Project Development Plan

    =============================================================================================
    Tasks
    =============================================================================================

    T0004 Create a factory for entities/ComponentSystem
    T0005 Fix imports for systems. No deep imports. Everything should be ' import X {Y,Z, ...} from 'Path to System'
    T0007 Create better physics with acceleration/collision.
    T0008 Create Animations when moving - Animations should not affect physics?
    T0010 we need to model time somehow other than saying 1 fram = 16ms
    T0011 Implement a logging system for debugging and fault finding. Could prop just be an RxSubject

    =============================================================================================
    Current Task
    =============================================================================================
    T0006 Create a 3D RenderSystem
        - Design a structure for setting up GL environment, Rendering multiple game objects with different models and materials
        - Perhaps a more flexible way to generate shaders. Something that sets uniforms, attribs and varyings -> Info object

    =============================================================================================
    Done Tasks
    =============================================================================================
    T0001 Implement Redux (RETRACTED)
    T0003 Design a structure for the game
    T0002 Establish communication Between 2D and 3D UI parts 
    T0009 Create The event system

    =============================================================================================
    T0009 Create The event system
    =============================================================================================
    The Event system have not been created as such, but a .ts file containing the Rx.Observalbes have been created
    and the components can import them. More structure will be added as required throughout the projct.

    =============================================================================================
    T0002 Establish communication Between 2D and 3D UI parts 
    =============================================================================================
    It seems relatively easy and actual implementation can be postponed until later.

    I did 2 different approaches to this:
    1) Created an Rx.Observable fromevent on the element catched by ID. This is very easily done. However you get a mouse event from it
    and that only contains screen coordinates so its hard to distinguish what UI element was clicked. Advantage is you can do it about
    anywhere in the code.

    2) You can define and export a Rx.Subject in the EventSystem (outside the class). Then you can import it in the root node of React and
    pass it as props down the tree to React.Compoents that need to interact with the Engine. You will need to create some UIEvent interfaces
    and manually link what buttons was pressed.

    3) Alternatively we could investigate if Redux is a good way to do stuff. Some Redux/Rxjs hybrid.

    conclussion is: Its possible and we are not shooting ourselves in the foot with the design.

    Adopted a ECS based game engine system isntead of object heirachies.

    The game state is a collection of entities. The entity class is basically just and entityId, with a hashMap of componentType => I[ComponentType].
    entityId = 1
    components = 
    {
        VISIBLE => instance of IVisible
        MOVABLE => instance of IMovable
    } 

    The systems then manages an internal collection of the subset of entities that is relevant to that system. These are added/removed when stuff is added/removed
    through the entity manager.

    The SceneGraph is basically just the relationship between GameObjects that appear in the game-world.

        World -> Character -> Sword -> Fire
                        -> Shield

    When the world moves, the character moves with it, when the character moves, the sword and shield moves 
    with it. In essence each node/GObj in the graph only needs to place it self in relation to the parent.

        worldMatrix = greatGrandParent * grandParent * parent * self(localMatrix)
